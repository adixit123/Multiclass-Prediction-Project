This is a multiclass prediction model built using Gradient Boosting for the Kaggle Competition MUlti-Class Prediction of Obesity Risk(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e2). I have used standard scaling and ordinalencoding to preprocess the 
data. The model has an accuracy of 0.87391.
